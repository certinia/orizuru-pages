# Welcome to Orizuru

Salesforce Heroku is an elastic cloud compute platform which perfectly complements the core Salesforce platform. However using the two platforms together today isn't that straightforward - creating applications where identity and processes span both platforms requires some effort.

FinancialForce Orizuru sets out to make it as simple as possible to add Heroku compute power to your Salesforce development projects.

Orizuru has three main parts:

First, we we have a number of freely available packages which provide features which will be regularly needed when building Salesforce-Heroku hybrid projects. These include identity, authentication and process control. These packages are written in Node.js and available via NPM. This is the Orizuru framework.

Second, we have built some command line tools that save a heap of time starting new projects. The tools allow you to create your initial project, include the Orizuru framework, and configure identification and authentication. These are the Orizuru tools.

Third, we are providing a sample application which demonstrates the Orizuru framework in a realistic and relatable way.
